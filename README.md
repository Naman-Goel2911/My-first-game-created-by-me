# My-first-game-created-by-me
You are an adventurer you travel to faraway lands in a boat and explore them. One day, you were sailing in the beautiful ocean. Suddenly a storm started and your boat began to shake between the water. The boat got flipped and you fell directly into the ocean. You got fainted. When you opened your eyes you found yourself in a village house. Two people were sitting beside you. You asked them, "How did I get here?" The people answered, "You were floating in the waves near the beach, so we took you to our house and helped you to survive. What is your Name?? You answered, "My name is Tom."  " You asked, "Can I go and explore your land and people??" They said, "Yes, we will be delighted." You go outside and find some people doing a ritual. You asked, "Why are you doing this??" The people answered, "To remove the zombies from our land." You are confused and get back into the house and ask the people, "How do you survive the zombies??" The people said, "We have to get into our house and not leave until the zombies are killed by the Vikings. If you want to go back to your home then use the portal above the hill, but the portal is only active when the zombies appear."  You need to get back to your homeland. So, find the portal, kill the zombies and get back to the hometown...
